When we first started thinking about starting a business together in early 2012, we came up with a diverse list of new product ideas that we could potentially pursue, including software, hardware, security, media, mobile, analytics, and more. Then a funny thing happened: we liked several of them but couldn't choose just one!

We figured that investors probably wouldn't fund a product company that was trying to concurrently build more than one product, so we tried to imagine a different kind of company that could realistically build a portfolio of market leading products across a diverse set of market segments.

We knew this company would need a non-traditional business model that could provide a perpetual source of non-dilutive capital to incubate our portfolio companies, as well as a continuous stream of new founders, top engineers, and great product ideas. Hence was born our Engineering as as Service consulting business.

Above all, we knew that in order to surface the best product ideas, our company would have to be based on a unique culture that elevates innovation be a first-class citizen, along side execution. 

Hire Hackers
------------
Attract really smart people with entrepreneurship in their DNA
Visionary, unconventional, tinkering, exploring, creative, hacker. And I love this one: unhinged!

> “Hackers are innovators. Hackers are people who challenge and change the systems to make them work differently and to make them work better. It’s just how they think. It’s a mindset.”

-- Logan Laplante (age 13)

Care
----
Take a stand, form an opinion, be a zealot. It's about passion.
Tenacious, persistent, driven, quirky, funny
Make decisions despite ambiguity. Know why. Know what must be done now and what can be improved later.

Question All Answers

Find the "Edge"

Fast is fun
Just enough rules and structure to hold us together, but never so much as to impede innovation or slow us down
Velocity
Fast, productive, efficient, agile

Have Integrity

Be authentic
Don't try to be what others think you should be
Do what you say. Honesty. Authenticity. Discipline. Teamwork. Selflessness.

Be Fearless!
------------
And above all, be totally fearless
Better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission
Always make new mistakes
