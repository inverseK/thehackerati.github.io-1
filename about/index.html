      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>The Hackerati exists because a few hackers found themselves with an 
      unquenchable thirst to build cool and innovative stuff! We quickly 
      discovered that businesses really need hackers to stay competitive in 
      this increasingly connected and data-driven world. Lots of hackers. More 
      than they can easily find. So we developed an immediate mission to help 
      address the shortage of qualified engineering talent in today's world. 
      The Hackerati is fulfilling this mission by offering Engineering as a 
      Service, The Hackerati Academy, and The Hackerati Labs.

        <p>To meet future demand for engineering talent, The Hackerati takes a multi-faceted approach to transforming our talent supply. In short, we want to help the world produce more engineers, better engineers. This starts by encouraging more students with aptitude to study advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs.
        </p>
        <p>By building an active presence on college campuses and sponsoring fun activities such as hackathons, The Hackerati makes engineering careers appealing to future generations. To underscore this commitment, we are donating a portion of our earnings to college engineering programs.

        <p>We also need to ensure that students and recent graduates are better prepared to work in professional engineering roles. The Hackerati does so by systematically providing them with opportunities to gain professional engineering experience.</p>
        <p>Traditional internships are a good start. But to meet future demand for top engineering talent, we also provide students and entry-level professionals with a deeper, more immersive experience. In the same way that the great art studios of the Renaissance paired artist apprentices with master artists, The Hackerati teams less experienced engineers with seasoned, professional hackers. With this approach, we provide not just a body of current technical knowledge, but also a platform from which to learn or invent new technologies throughout one's career, a framework for solving complex problems, and a passion for doing so.</p>

        <p>The Hackerati's unique approach to engineering services helps businesses, students, and universities: Our staffing model of blending leading experts with experienced engineers and student apprentices allows us to supply businesses with high-end Engineering as a Service at a moderate price. Students earn money to help pay for school while graduating with a year or more of professional engineering experience. 
        </p>
        <p>Academic institutions grow revenue as we collectively advance our mission to prepare the next generation of engineers for the workforce. Each sphere fuels the others in this symbiotic model, bringing progress to all fronts.
