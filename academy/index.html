        <p class="left span6">The Hackerati Academy was conceived and created both for the training of 
        entry-level employees and for the continuous education of experienced employees. 
        General prerequisites for all courses include a solid understanding of fundamental 
        engineering skills, mastery of at least one programming language (we don't care 
        which one), propensity for solving hard problems, and general fearlessness.

        <h1>Pedagogy</h1>
        <p>Academy courses cover advanced topics in agile development, the latest technologies, 
        and the most effective UI/UX practices for a variety of devices and platforms. Every 
        course is project-based and team-oriented, just like real-world agile development efforts.
        The focus of the course work is the application of individually acquired technical knowledge
        on a professional project team, rather than the acquisition of technical knowledge itself. 
        Each course has specific prerequisites and resources for individual study.
        <br /><br />
        Our training methodologies reflect what we do everyday at work.  Our courses incorporate
        writing stories, planning sprints, holding daily stand-ups, practicing Test-Driven Development,
        utilizing Continuous Integration, and holding retrospectives. Participants will not only take 
        away the technical knowledge thatâ€™s covered in each course, but also an intimate understanding
        of what it feels like to work on an advanced engineering initiative as a member of a Hackerati
        team.
