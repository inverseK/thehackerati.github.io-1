            <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
            <p>
                Academy courses cover advanced topics in agile development, the latest technologies, and the most effective UI/UX practices for a variety of devices and platforms. Every course is project-based and team-oriented, just like real-world agile development efforts. The focus of the course work is the application of individually acquired technical knowledge on a professional project team, rather than the acquisition of technical knowledge itself. Each course has specific prerequisites and resources for individual study.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Our training methodologies reflect what we do every day at work. Our courses incorporate writing stories, planning sprints, holding daily stand-ups, practicing Test-Driven Development, utilizing Continuous Integration, and holding retrospectives. Participants will not only take away the technical knowledge thatâ€™s covered in each course, but also an intimate understanding of what it feels like to work on an advanced engineering initiative as a member of a Hackerati team.
