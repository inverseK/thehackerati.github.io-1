        <p>The Hackerati Academy was conceived and created both for the training of 
        entry-level employees and for the continuous education of experienced employees.</p>

        <p>General prerequisites for all courses include a solid understanding of fundamental 
        engineering skills, mastery of at least one programming language (we don't care 
        which one), propensity for solving hard problems, and general fearlessness.

      <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
      <p> Academy courses cover advanced topics in agile development, the latest technologies, 
      and the most effective UI/UX practices for a variety of devices and platforms. Every 
      course is project-based and team-oriented, just like real-world agile development efforts.
      The focus of the course work is the application of individually acquired technical knowledge
      on a professional project team, rather than the acquisition of technical knowledge itself. 
      Each course has specific prerequisites and resources for individual study.
      </p>
      <p> Our training methodologies reflect what we do every day at work.  Our courses incorporate
      writing stories, planning sprints, holding daily stand-ups, practicing Test-Driven Development,
      utilizing Continuous Integration, and holding retrospectives. Participants will not only take 
      away the technical knowledge thatâ€™s covered in each course, but also an intimate understanding
      of what it feels like to work on an advanced engineering initiative as a member of a Hackerati
      team.
