<p>Michael is, at his core, a writer—but that didn't keep him from studying engineering at Cooper Union. Much to his amazement, it also didn't keep him from graduating! He now leads Operations at The Hackerati—a position that has allowed him to realize his passion for working with engineers, rather than as one. His roles include business development, project management, recruiting, event coordination, copywriting, and just about everything else associated with growing a startup...like solidifying [his own corny] jokes and puns with a ba-dum-tsh on his desktop drum kit.

<p>Michael hacks in English. He's working on learning some languages that [nonhuman] computers will understand, but also realizes that computers will be converting spoken English into code soon enough. Call it a Catch-22. His primary outlet as a writer is spoken word poetry, which he's beginning to convert into music with the help of Derby and The Hackerati Band.

<p>Above all else, Michael enjoys conversations with genuine people. He's also keen on refined user experiences, well-crafted verbal permutations, —em dashes—, wearables/BCIs/transhumanism, and the freedom to speak his mind. He's increasingly more excited to be alive [just take a look around!], and you'll surely notice this energy when you meet him in person. You’ve been warned.</p>
