Ramon graduated from Cooper Union's Electrical Engineering program in May 2012, and was promptly offered a position as a founding Hackerati developer by his professor, Rob Marano. Ramon started hacking in college, and has picked up an extensive skillset in that short amount of time. He mainly hacks in C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript to produce solutions in artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer security, natural language processing, and distributed computing. While not hacking, Ramon is holding down the ping pong table, breakdancing, and playing video games. He beat I Wanna Be The Guy on the Very Hard difficulty level, and he tells us that this is, indeed, very hard to do.
