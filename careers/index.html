            <h3>The Guild Model</h3>

            <p>
                At The Hackerati, we believe that the best 
                way to learn new skills is through guided, 
                hands-on experience. So we&#39;ve taken a page 
                from the playbook of medieval guilds&#8211;in which 
                master artisans passed on the secrets of 
                their trade to those who were less experienced&#8211;to 
                create an environment of continuous teaching 
                and learning, tailored to producing master engineers.
